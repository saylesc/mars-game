        Well done! You have successfully placed the nanites! Unfortunately, 
        however, that triangle is too small to construct a solar panel.
        <br><br> As you can see, the DrawTriangle procedure comes with a 
        built-in unit triangle. You can adjust the vertices of the triangle by 
        applying mathematical operations to them.  The first thing that you 
        need to do is to dilate your triangle, or change it's size.  This is 
        done by multiplying the X and Y values of each vertex by the amount 
        that you want the triangle to grow or shrink.
        <br><br>Of note, dilation only works properly when one of the vertices
        is at (0,0) - but for now, that's not a problem.
