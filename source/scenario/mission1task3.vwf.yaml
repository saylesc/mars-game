        You have executed a movement command and picked up your helicam! 
        <br><br>Let's take a minute and look around the game window. 
        <br><br>In the <strong><em>top right</em></strong> corner are the camera controls 
        that let you switch between first-person camera, third-person camera, 
        and Helicam (or top-down) view.  You can move the camera using the arrow 
        keys, the W, A, S, and D keys, or by right-click and dragging.
        <br><br>In the <strong><em>top left</em></strong> corner, you can see the 
        currently active rover, as well as your available power and your current 
        position.
        <br><br>In the <strong><em>bottom left</em></strong> are the mission objective 
        and the chat window (which shows everything that the characters in the 
        game have said). This area is a great place to look when you're stuck, 
        as it often contains hints about your current task.
        <br><br>Finally, in the <strong><em>bottom right</em></strong> are several 
        control buttons. You have already used the PROGRAM button. The GRAPH 
        button will be introduced in Mission 2. The TILES button enables a 
        display that shows where you can move. This MISSION button re-opens this 
        window, in case you want to read it again. Finally, the OPTIONS button
        lets you adjust system settings or go back to the main menu.
