        Well done!  
        <br><br>Now that you’ve got the basics under control and have gathered 
        up nearby equipment, it’s time to recover the radio at the far end of 
        the crash site and make contact with Mission Control. Of course, getting
        there through all of this debris may require a bit of care...
        <br><br>As you work, you may want to switch to Helicam view and use
        the arrow keys to look around. You can also use the TILES button to
        count spaces and see where you can and can't move. Finally, if you 
        want to start over you can hit the RESET button (next to the START 
        button in your programming interface) to clear your program out and go
        back to what you had at the start of the task.
