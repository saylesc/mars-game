        You have accessed your programming interface! 
        <br><br>Now that you've got your programming interface open, you need
        to build your first program. In order to do that, you drag the blocks 
        that you want to use from the <strong><em>palette</em></strong> (on the 
        left-hand side of the window) to the <strong><em>assembly area</em></strong> (on 
        the right), and then hit the START button (in the bottom right) to
        run your program.
        <br><br>While you're here, notice the <strong><em>categories</em></strong> to the left 
        of the palette. Right now there's only one category of blocks, but more
        will be added as you progress. You can open and close the palette by 
        clicking on the category.
